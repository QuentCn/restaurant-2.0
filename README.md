# restaurant-2.0


## The misson 

So that's the mission we had to do using Bootstrap :


The website must be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. It must at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.

Welcome
A page with one Jumbotron and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc…​).

Menu
A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

Pictures
A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).

Restaurant
A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.

Contact
A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.

If you want to make an even more complex website feel free to try new things and make it as beautiful as possible.


SO I try



## The restaurant page

I'm from belgium so i like beer's and fries and also some of traditionnal dishes from belgium (and others contry to but's not the theme of the restaurant).

So the theme of restaurant I choose is a classic restaurant that we call here "brasserie", with beers and traditional dishes or revisited dishes.

There is a total of 5 pages in the web site with :
- Welcome page
- about us 
- pictures gallery 
- Menu page 
- contact page
